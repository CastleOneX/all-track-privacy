# Privacy Policy — All-Track

Last updated: 2026-01-20

This Privacy Policy explains how **All-Track** (the “App”) handles information.


## 1) Summary

- The App is designed to work **100% on-device**.
- The App **does not send** your tracked items, URLs, or price history to the developer’s servers.
- When you browse websites inside the App, those **third-party websites** may collect data according to their own policies.

## 2) Information the App stores on your device

The App may store the following information locally on your device to provide price tracking features:

- Product URLs you add to your watchlist
- A captured CSS selector for the price element (used to find the same price later)
- The current price and a local price history
- App preferences (e.g., thresholds, background-check settings)

This information is stored locally. It is used only to run the App’s features.

## 3) Information we do not collect

- We do not collect personal information on developer-controlled servers.
- We do not sell your information.
- We do not share your watchlist data with third parties.

## 4) Third-party websites you visit

The App includes an in-app browser to let you visit external websites (online stores and other pages). Those websites are operated by third parties and may collect information from your device and browser session (for example, cookies or other identifiers) according to their own privacy policies.

We recommend reviewing the privacy policy of each website you visit.

## 5) Permissions

Depending on what you enable, the App may request the following permissions:

- **Internet**: required to load web pages you choose to visit.
- **Notifications**: used to notify you about price changes if you enable alerts.
- **Foreground service / background execution** (Android): used to perform periodic checks if you enable background checking.
- **Display over other apps (overlay)** (Android, optional): may be requested to improve reliability of background checks on some devices/Android versions.

You can manage permissions in your device settings.

## 6) Data retention and deletion

- You can remove tracked items from the watchlist within the App.
- Uninstalling the App removes the App’s locally stored data from your device.

## 7) Children’s privacy

The App is not directed to children. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## 8) Changes to this policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The “Last updated” date at the top indicates when it was last revised.
