The Application is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. The Company expressly disclaims all warranties, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to, warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. We do not guarantee that the Application will function uninterrupted, error-free, or that the data processed by the local agent will be accurate or obtained in real-time.

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Company, its directors, employees, or affiliates be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages. This includes, without limitation, loss of profits, loss of data, loss of business opportunities, excessive consumption of device resources (battery, mobile data), or hardware wear and tear resulting from the use or inability to use the Application.

In jurisdictions that do not allow the total exclusion of liability, the Company's cumulative liability shall be strictly limited to the amount you have paid to the Company for the use of the Application during the twelve (12) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim.
